Future
------
[#] Add Windows support (Feature request: http://flux-net.net/bugs/view.php?id=9)
[ ] Check how many users are in each joined channel, if the bot is the only one then leave the channel and send /who's to the
    channel instead. This makes it so we're not holding open dead channels. If the bot is the only bot on the network, then it
    shouldnt matter whether we stay in the channel or not so we'll just keep the bot there.
[ ] Fix bot logic if we get locked by nickserv or something
[ ] Add NickServ support

Optional
--------
[ ] Add Mode Handler
  [+] Parse 005 Numeric for modes and server support stuff, take action on it
  [ ] Add u->IsOp()
